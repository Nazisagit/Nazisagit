ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Nazisagit
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ruby, python, generally anything that can be used to build something interesting

# Education
I have a bachelor's in Computer Science from King's College London.
I did specialize in AI, but so far that part of the degree hasn't been made use of.

# Experience
I spent my first 2 years in my career as a software engineer, maining in Ruby on Rails.
Currently, I am an engineering manager of almost 3 years and I'm looking to go back to an individual contributor role.

# Interests
I mostly play video games, but I'm also into reading some good fiction and horror with a sprinkling of socio-politics.
Lately, I've gotten into watches and changing out their straps.
